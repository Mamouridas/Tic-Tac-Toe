# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple tic-tac-toe for 2 players


This is a mini-game in Python that allows a group of 2 people to play the famous game named tic-tac-toe.

In this version players have to dicide who will start first and then use coordinates to put their mark on the board.

The coordinates have the form of A,B,C horizontally and 1,2,3 vertically. So for the top left the player must type a1
and for the bottom right c3 (The board is printed after every move).


Next version will have a player vs bot feature and in the future I am going to make it work with a GUI.
